# A-Data-Driven-Approach-to-Flight-Price-Prediction-using-Regression-Models.
This notebook contains the implementation of flight price prediction using machine learning models. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.


The objective of this project is to construct a robust regression model that can accurately forecast the price of a flight by considering various features such as airline, source city, destination city, class, duration, and days left until departure. Through the implementation of advanced algorithms including Linear Regression and 2 other types,  the project aims to provide travelers with reliable predictions to optimize their travel costs and decision-making process.
